# rstmdb Server Configuration
#
# Copy this file to config.yaml and customize as needed.
# Start server with: RSTMDB_CONFIG=config.yaml cargo run
#
# Environment variables override config file values.

# Network settings
network:
  # Address to bind to
  bind_addr: "127.0.0.1:7401"

  # Idle connection timeout in seconds
  idle_timeout_secs: 300

  # Maximum concurrent connections
  max_connections: 1000

# Authentication settings
auth:
  # Require authentication for all commands (except HELLO, AUTH, PING, BYE)
  required: false

  # Token hashes (SHA-256). Generate with: rstmdb-cli hash-token <your-token>
  # token_hashes:
  #   - "e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855"

  # Or load from external secrets file (one hash per line, # for comments)
  # secrets_file: "/etc/rstmdb/tokens.secret"

# Storage settings
storage:
  # Data directory (WAL and snapshots stored here)
  data_dir: "./data"

  # WAL segment size in megabytes
  # Smaller = more frequent rotation, faster compaction
  # Larger = better write performance
  wal_segment_size_mb: 64

  # Fsync policy for durability vs performance tradeoff
  # Options:
  #   every_write  - safest, fsync after every write
  #   every_n: 100 - fsync after every N writes
  #   every_ms: 100 - fsync every N milliseconds
  #   never        - fastest, no fsync (data loss on crash)
  fsync_policy: every_write

  # Maximum number of versions per state machine (0 = unlimited)
  # When limit is reached, new versions will be rejected
  max_machine_versions: 0

# TLS settings
tls:
  # Enable TLS
  enabled: false

  # Path to PEM-encoded server certificate
  # cert_path: "/etc/rstmdb/server-cert.pem"

  # Path to PEM-encoded server private key

  # Require client certificate authentication (mTLS)
  require_client_cert: false

  # Path to CA certificate for verifying client certs (for mTLS)
  # client_ca_path: "/etc/rstmdb/client-ca.pem"

# Automatic compaction settings
compaction:
  # Enable automatic compaction
  enabled: true

  # Compact after this many events (0 = disabled)
  events_threshold: 10000

  # Compact when WAL exceeds this size in MB (0 = disabled)
  size_threshold_mb: 100

  # Minimum interval between auto-compactions in seconds
  min_interval_secs: 60

# Prometheus metrics settings
metrics:
  # Enable metrics HTTP server
  enabled: false

  # Address to bind the metrics server to
  # Metrics available at http://<bind_addr>/metrics
